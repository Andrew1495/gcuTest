# Brief

"The user should be able to search for and retrieve a word definition from the API and be able to
“favourite” the word and its definition for a future session. Stored definitions should be listed
somewhere on the page."


## Installation

Note: This setup tutorial assumes that you already have installed a package manager like npm  and the version control system git.
**From Terminal run either the shh or https:**
  
  ssh code
      ``` git clone git@github.com:Andrew1495/gcuTest.git``` 
  
  https code
      ``` git clone https://github.com/Andrew1495/gcuTest.git```
  
  
Once the download has ended, move into the directory named gcu_tech_test by running the following command:

``` cd gcu_tech_test ``` 
  
Now to install all the modules for the client, run this command:

``` npm i ```

Once all packages are installed, run this command:

``` npm start ```
  
Verify it is running correctly by browsing http://localhost:3000
